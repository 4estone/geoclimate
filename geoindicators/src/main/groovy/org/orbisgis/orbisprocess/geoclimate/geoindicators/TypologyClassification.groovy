/**
 * This process is used to assign to a Reference Spatial Unit (RSU) a Local Climate Zone type (Stewart et Oke, 2012).
 * This assignment is performed according to the 7 indicators used for LCZ classification. Each LCZ type has a
 * given range for each of the 7 indicators. Then the method to find the LCZ type that is the most appropriate for
 * a given RSU is based on the minimum distance to each LCZ (in the 7 dimensions space). In order to calculate this
 * distance, each dimension is normalized according to the mean and the standard deviation (or median and absolute median
 * deviation) of the interval values. Some of the indicators may be more important (or reliable) than the other
 * for the LCZ identification. In order to manage this point, a map containing weights may be passed and will be
 * used to multiply the distance due to a given indicator.
 *
 * @param rsuLczIndicators The table name where are stored ONLY the LCZ indicator such as defined by Stewart et Oke (2012),
 * the RSU id and the RSU geometries
 * @param rsuAllIndicators The table name where are stored all the RSU indicators (useful to improve the classification algorithm)
 * @param normalisationType The indicators used for normalisation of the indicators
 *          --> "AVG": the mean and the standard deviation are used
 *          --> "MEDIAN": the median and the mediane absolute deviation are used
 * @param mapOfWeights Values that will be used to increase or decrease the weight of an indicator (which are the key
 * of the map) for the LCZ classification step (default : all values to 1)
 * @param prefixName String use as prefix to name the output table
 * @param datasource A connection to a database
 * @param industrialFractionThreshold The fraction of industrial building area above which the RSU is considered as industrial type (LCZ10)

/**
 * This process is used to create a classification model based on a RandomForest algorithm.
 * The training dataset and the variables to use for the training may be gathered in a
 * same table. All parameters of the randomForest algorithm have default values but may be
 * modified. The resulting model is returned and may also be saved into a file.
 *
 * Note that the algorithm is based on the Smile library (cf. https://github.com/haifengl/smile)
 *
 * @param trainingTableName The name of the training table where are stored ONLY the explicative variables
 * and the one to model
 * @param varToModel String where is saved the name of the field to model
 * @param save Boolean to save the model into a file if needed
 * @param pathAndFileName String of the path and name where the model has to be saved (default "/home/RfModel")
 * @param ntrees The number of trees to build the forest
 * @param mtry The number of input variables to be used to determine the decision
 * at a node of the tree. p/3 seems to give generally good performance,
 * where p is the number of variables
 * @param rule Decision tree split rule (The function to measure the quality of a split. Supported rules
 * are “gini” for the Gini impurity and “entropy” for the information gain)
 * @param maxDepth The maximum depth of the tree.
 * @param maxNodes The maximum number of leaf nodes in the tree.
 * @param nodeSize The number of instances in a node below which the tree will
 * not split, setting nodeSize = 5 generally gives good results.
 * @param subsample The sampling rate for training tree. 1.0 means sampling with replacement. < 1.0 means
 * sampling without replacement.
 * @param datasource A connection to a database
 *
 * @return RfModel A randomForest model (see smile library for further information about the object)
