# Spatial units

Geoclimate performs indicator computation at three spatial units.
A spatial unit corresponds to a geometry area (POLYGON or MULTIPOLYGON). 
It qualifies the best representing spatial object to compile geographical properties 
and characteristics. The  spatial units stands for a nested spatial relationship where 
the building is the lowest common feature denominator as described in [Bocher et al, 2018](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.uclim.2018.01.008).


- the **building**, a collection of features that represent structures with a roof and walls, such as a house or factory.
- the **[block](./chain_documentation/spatial_units/block.md)** : a set of buildings that touches (at least one point in common)
- the ***[Reference Spatial Unit]((./chain_documentation/spatial_units/rsu.md))***, also called  RSU, which is a continuous and homogeneous way to divide the space,  using topographic constraint such as roads, rail ways, vegetation and water areas in addition to administrative boundaries ([see how it's made](./spatial_units/rsu.md)).
