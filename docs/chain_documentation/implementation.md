## Architecture

The Geoclimate algorithms are implemented on top of the [OrbisData]((https://github.com/orbisgis/orbisdata)) library. 
Orbisdata provides a unique access point to query, manage, retrieve data. 
Orbisdata is based on lambda expressions and sugar programming methods introduced since JAVA 8. 
Orbisdata is closed to Groovy syntax and aims to provide an elegant and fluent framework to play with geospatial data.
