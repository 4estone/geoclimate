# Abstract input model



This page presents the data dictionary used to describe the geographic data that feed the GeoClimate chain. The data are organized by topics. For each of them, we provide the input tables dictionary (with the name and type of the fields â€“ prefixed with `input_`) and the associated metadata tables, in which description and parameters are stored :
1. [Building](#Buildings): input_BUILDING, BUILDING_Abstract_use_&_type, BUILDING_Abstract_parameters
2. [Roads](#2.-Roads): input_ROAD, ROAD_Abstract_type, ROAD_Abstract_surface, ROAD_Abstract_parameters
3. Rail ways: input_RAIL, RAIL_Abstract_type
4. Vegetation areas: input_VEGET, VEGET_Abstract_type
5. Hydrographic areas: input_HYDRO
6. Zones: ZONE, ZONE_NEIGHBORS

For each individual value concerning the type or use of a building (values listed in the BUILDING_Abstract_use_&_type metadata table), this list specifies the rules for calculating the number of levels of a building in order to feed the `nb_lvl` field of the `input_building` table.

- Term: value used to describe the type and the main use of a building

- Nb_lev: Specifies whether or not the building type is taken into account when calculating the number of levels (`0` = not taken into account (in this case, the number of levels will be forced to 1) / `1`= taken into account (in this case, a formula will be used to deduct the number) / `2` = other situtation (rule).
