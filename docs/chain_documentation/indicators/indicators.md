# Indicators

Geoclimate proposes more than 60 geospatial indicators computed at the three spatial units.
They are used to measure morphological properties (e.g form factor), describe spatial organizations (distance measurements, patch metrics, shape index, spatial density, *etc*).
They are used to quantify the shape and pattern of urban and landscape structures.

Below are listed the three scales of indicators:

- [Building's indicators](./indicators/building.md)
- [Block's indicators](./indicators/block.md)
- [RSU's indicators](./indicators/rsu.md)
