# Geoclimate implementation



## Architecture

The Geoclimate algorithms are implemented on top of the [OrbisData]((https://github.com/orbisgis/orbisdata)) library, which:

- provides a unique access point to query, manage, retrieve data.
- is based on lambda expressions and sugar programming methods introduced since JAVA 8.
- is closed to Groovy syntax and aims to provide an elegant and fluent framework to play with geospatial data.
